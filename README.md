This project aims to develop an advanced predictive maintenance system for turbofan engines used in aircraft. The primary objective is to predict the number of remaining operational cycles before failure, also known as the Remaining Useful Life (RUL), for each turbofan engine based on historical data and real-time engine parameters.
